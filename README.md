# Matrix Calculator

This is a Matrix Calculator project implemented in Python using Tkinter for the user interface. The calculator allows you to perform various operations on 2D and 3D matrices.

## Features

### Supported Operations
1. Add Two Matrices: Perform addition of two matrices of the same dimensions.
2. Multiply Two Matrices: Multiply two matrices using standard matrix multiplication rules.
3. Calculate the Inverse of a Matrix: Compute the inverse of a square matrix.
4. Solve a System of Linear Equations: Solve systems of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x (recommended: Python 3.11 or later)
* Tkinter (for the graphical user interface)

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andriy852/Matrix-Calculator.git
cd tkinter_project
```
2. **Install Dependencies**:

Ensure that Tkinter is installed on your system:
* macOS: Install Tkinter via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install tcl-tk
```
* For Windows/Linux: Tkinter is generally included with Python, but you may need to install the python3-tk package via your system's package manager if it's missing.
3. **Run the program**: Open a terminal and run the tkiner_project.py file:
